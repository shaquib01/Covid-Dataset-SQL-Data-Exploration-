# Covid Dataset (SQL Data Exploration) Project

## Overview

This repository contains a SQL data exploration project focused on analyzing and gaining insights from a dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This project leverages SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data from the dataset. The goal is to provide valuable information and visualizations related to COVID-19 trends and statistics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to COVID-19 cases, including:

- Date
- Country/Region
- Confirmed cases
- Recovered cases
- Deaths
- Vaccination

The dataset source and any preprocessing steps should be mentioned here.

## SQL Database

We have imported the dataset into a PostgreSQL database for efficient data querying and analysis. SQL queries are used to retrieve, transform, and analyze the data.

## SQL Queries

A collection of SQL queries is provided in this repository to perform various analyses on the dataset. These queries cover a range of topics, such as:

- Daily and cumulative cases
- Top affected countries
- Growth rate calculations
- Geographic distribution

Detailed explanations and examples for running these queries are available in the [Queries](queries/) directory.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shaquib01/Covid-Dataset-SQL-Data-Exploration/
   ```

2. Set up the PostgreSQL database and import the dataset.

   - Detailed instructions for database setup and data import can be found in the [Database Setup](database-setup/) directory.

3. Run the SQL queries using your preferred SQL client or tool.

   - Refer to the [Queries](queries/) directory for examples of SQL queries.

4. Explore the results, visualize data, and gain insights from the COVID-19 dataset.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have ideas for additional analyses, improvements to existing queries, or any other enhancements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
